I am working on putting together content for this talk:

https://www.fabricfebruary.com/precon/analyst/

that I am delivering at Fabric February in two weeks.  I know, I am way behind.

I have an idea on the topics I want to discuss.  My primary goal is to try and find valid technical and non-technical reasons Power BI developers should or should not migrate to Microsoft Fabric.

I have 6.5 hours to deliver the content. This content, should have the following:

1.  Slides that can be shared as handouts.
2.  Demos, that can be followed-along as a lab.
3.  Prereqs for workshop

I would like to develop the content in sections of the next 10 days.  The sections that I have come up with are as follows:

Strategic Context: When and why Fabric makes sense

CI/CD & Git Integration: Version control and deployment automations

Data Centralization: Lakehouse, Warehouse

Dataflows Gen2 and Pipelines: Modern data integration, Notebooks

Model Size

Direct Lake: New storage mode for performance optimization

Semantic Link 

Copilot: AI-assisted development

This is just a Patrick brainstorm.  I would love to get your thoughts and suggestions on the top.  

Can you start a brainstorm.md file that we can use as a scratch workspace to get going?
